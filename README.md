# Granite State Code Camp Google Assistant Fulfillment Code
 This code is to be used as part of a Dialogflow's Agent Fulfillment code or deployed as a Cloud Function used as a Dialogflow Webhook.
 
 This code contains several intents that generate both simple responses and rich responses (using Basic Card, List and Image components) and also shows how to call external APIs using the fetch API.
 
 Please feel free to use as example for your own fulfillment code.

 Thanks
